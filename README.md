# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This repository is created as part of a learning module on **Requirement Analysis** in software development. It aims to document the essential activities, tools, and best practices involved in gathering, analyzing, validating, and managing software requirements.

The goal is to understand how effective requirement analysis contributes to building better software by reducing misunderstandings, avoiding scope creep, and ensuring stakeholder satisfaction.

Feel free to explore the resources, examples, and diagrams that will be added throughout this repository.

ðŸ“– What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the goals, functions, and constraints of a software system are identified, gathered, analyzed, and documented. This process involves interacting with stakeholdersâ€”including users, clients, and developersâ€”to understand what the software needs to accomplish.

âœ… Key Objectives of Requirement Analysis:
- Identify user needs and expectations.

- Understand functional and non-functional requirements.

- Define clear and unambiguous system behavior.

- Align requirements with business goals.

- Lay the foundation for design, development, and testing phases.

ðŸš€ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- Prevents Miscommunication: Ensures all stakeholders are on the same page.

- Reduces Rework: Helps avoid costly changes later in development.

- Guides Design & Development: Acts as a blueprint for system implementation.

- Manages Scope: Helps define project boundaries and avoid scope creep.

- Improves Quality: Ensures the final product meets user expectations and business needs.
