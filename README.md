# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## üìå Introduction

This repository is created as part of a learning module on **Requirement Analysis** in software development. It aims to document the essential activities, tools, and best practices involved in gathering, analyzing, validating, and managing software requirements.

The goal is to understand how effective requirement analysis contributes to building better software by reducing misunderstandings, avoiding scope creep, and ensuring stakeholder satisfaction.

Feel free to explore the resources, examples, and diagrams that will be added throughout this repository.

üìñ What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the goals, functions, and constraints of a software system are identified, gathered, analyzed, and documented. This process involves interacting with stakeholders‚Äîincluding users, clients, and developers‚Äîto understand what the software needs to accomplish.

‚úÖ Key Objectives of Requirement Analysis:
- Identify user needs and expectations.

- Understand functional and non-functional requirements.

- Define clear and unambiguous system behavior.

- Align requirements with business goals.

- Lay the foundation for design, development, and testing phases.

üöÄ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- Prevents Miscommunication: Ensures all stakeholders are on the same page.

- Reduces Rework: Helps avoid costly changes later in development.

- Guides Design & Development: Acts as a blueprint for system implementation.

- Manages Scope: Helps define project boundaries and avoid scope creep.

- Improves Quality: Ensures the final product meets user expectations and business needs.
‚ùó Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
  Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in ensuring the success of a software project. It acts as the bridge between stakeholders and developers, ensuring that the final product is aligned with business objectives and user expectations.

üîë Key Reasons Requirement Analysis is Critical:
 1.Ensures Clarity and Alignment

 By gathering and analyzing requirements early, teams can avoid misunderstandings and ensure all stakeholders agree on what the 
 system should do.

 2.Reduces Project Risks and Costs

 Identifying issues and gaps in the requirements phase helps catch potential problems before development begins, saving time and money later in the project.

3.Guides Design, Development, and Testing

A well-analyzed set of requirements provides a foundation for system design, coding, and quality assurance, ensuring the end product is reliable and meets expectations.

üîç Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
The Requirement Analysis process involves several structured activities that help ensure the final system meets user and business needs. Below are the five key activities:

- Requirement Gathering

The initial step where information is collected from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, observations, and questionnaires.

Focuses on understanding the business goals, user expectations, and problem domain.

- Requirement Elicitation

Involves refining and uncovering requirements through interactive techniques like brainstorming, workshops, prototyping, and use cases.

Helps stakeholders articulate needs they might not be able to express clearly at first.

- Requirement Documentation

 Converts gathered and elicited requirements into structured documentation such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user 
 stories, or use case diagrams.

 Ensures consistency, clarity, and completeness in the requirement statements.

- Requirement Analysis and Modeling

 Involves categorizing, prioritizing, and resolving conflicts among requirements.

 Uses modeling tools like data flow diagrams (DFDs), entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs), and use case diagrams to visualize the system's behavior and structure.

- Requirement Validation

Focuses on reviewing and confirming requirements with stakeholders to ensure they are accurate, complete, and feasible.

Helps detect ambiguities, inconsistencies, or contradictions before development begins

üß© Types of Requirements
In software development, requirements are generally classified into two main categories: Functional Requirements and Non-functional Requirements. Both are essential for delivering a complete and usable system.

‚úÖ Functional Requirements
Definition:
Functional requirements define what the system should do‚Äîthey describe the core functions, features, and interactions the software must support.

Examples for a Booking Management Project:

 -Users must be able to search for available properties by location and date.

 -The system should allow user registration and login with authentication.

 -Users can book a property, and the system should confirm the reservation.

 -Admins must be able to add, update, or delete property listings.

 -Users should receive email notifications for booking confirmations and cancellations.

üõ† Non-functional Requirements
Definition:
Non-functional requirements specify how the system should perform. They relate to quality attributes such as performance, usability, security, and reliability.

Examples for a Booking Management Project:

 -The website must load within 2 seconds for 90% of user interactions.

 -The system should support up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.

 -All user data must be encrypted and stored securely in compliance with GDPR.

 -The platform should maintain 99.9% uptime throughout the year.

 -The interface must be accessible on mobile devices and screen readers.
